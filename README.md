### Notes/Assumptions

Substantial feature:  
Ability to slow down time for three seconds after picking up a certain power-up.
To do this, a Timer was implemented, and the GameManager class holds a boolean in charge of whether the ability is able
to be used.


The scores file holds 1100 as a high score for testing purposes. Remove 1100 from the scores file
before playing the game.
