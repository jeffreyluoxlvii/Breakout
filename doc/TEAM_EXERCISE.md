# Teamwork Exercise
### Jeffrey Luo and Roy Xiong

## Round 1

 * How did it feel to be in a team when one person is more capable than the other?  
 It felt frustrating to be the person using the non-dominant hand.
 


## Round 2

Notice if you feel resentful, frustrated, proud, confident, etc.

 * How did it feel when you are having an easier time than your partner with the task?  
 It felt proud to finish first.

 * How did it feel when you are having a harder time than your partner?  
 It felt resentful to be slower than the other person. 


## Round 3

 * Did you ask for help when you need it? Did you offer?  
 We both gave suggenstions to the other person to help them sort faster.

 * How do you offer help without offending? How do you ask for help without guilt?  
 Put each other on the same level. Know that the other person will most likely also need help sometime later. 

 * What would it feel like if one partner took over and did the entire task, leaving you out?  
It would make us feel insignificant and unwanted.


## Round 4

 * How did you and your partner get better with the task over time?  
 We each gave suggestions, and tried the other person's suggestions.
