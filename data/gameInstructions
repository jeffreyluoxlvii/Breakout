This is a hyper-advanced, experimental, sci-fi
version of the normal arcade game Breakout.
In this game, there are 3 levels, and the
goal of each level is to destroy all the bricks
without losing all of your lives. Occasionally,
cool power-ups will drop from bricks. Keep
an eye out for these! You control your platform
with the mouse.
Now, enough of this tom foolery.
It's time to start playing!
